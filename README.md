# Iris_Flower_Detection
Iris flower detection uses machine learning to classify iris species—setosa, versicolor, and virginica—based on features like sepal and petal lengths and widths. By analyzing these attributes, algorithms enable precise identification, demonstrating the power of data-driven methods in biology and pattern recognition.
